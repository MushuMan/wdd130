        <p class="background">I'm currently studying for the field of computer science, and this is my first semester here. I see it useful to know how to work with web design in my chosen field because it will allow me to better communicate with others through the internet.</p>
        <p>I've been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints for all my life. I really only have one hobby and that is playing games of all sorts, but mostly video games. I am the youngest of 4 children, all boys, and I have a cat that I absolutely love named Eclipse.</p>
