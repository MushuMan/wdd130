                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>The Rubik's cube was invented by Erno Rubik in 1974, hence the name Rubik's cube. Over the next few years the iconic toy was picked up by a few different manufacturers and eventually made its international debut in 1980. It didn't take long before the puzzle became a recognizable staple in homes around the world. As of today the Rubik's Cube is the best selling puzzle toy/game, with over 450 million of the brain-scratchers sold as of 2021. Over the years many have enjoyed playing around with the device and various techniques have arisen for solving the enigma. One prominent feature of the cubing community as it is called is the advent of speedcubing. </p>

                    <h2>Speed Cubing</h2>
                    <p>With the popularity of the Rubik's Cube it didn't take long before a smaller community focused on solving the toy as fast as possible. During 1982 the first event was held for what is named speedcubing. This ended with the first holder of the world record with a speed of 22.95 seconds to solve by Minh Thai. Over the years this time has been cut down to ridiculous amounts. As of today the current world record holder is Max Park who achieved a singles time of 3.13 seconds to solve the puzzle. Along with this the current record holder for a series is Yiheng Wang with an average time of 4.48 seconds over a series of five solves. This is very impressive considering the many states a cube can be in, and that to solve it perfectly can be done in less than 20 moves for any given permutation.</p>

                    <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
                    <p>Over at Google a team researched and concluded that for any given position, a Rubik's Cube can be solved in 20 moves or less. This is quite impressive given the amount of possible combinations the cube can be in. The classic 3x3 puzzle has a total of 43 quintillion possibilities with only one being solved. Because of this astronomical number the use of algorithms is needed in order to solve the puzzle from any position. There have been many different algorithms that have come up over the years for solving the puzzle, but each utilizes the same terminology. </p>

                    <h2>Terminology</h2>
                    <p>There are a few different terms used when talking about the Rubik's Cube. To understand these it's useful to know the different pieces of the cube first. Each puzzle has six sides composed of one center, four edges, and four corners. With these each side has a unique centerpiece which doesn't move. Every edge piece shares two sides, having two colors making a total of 12 pieces. Lastly every corner piece shares three sides having three colors and totalling to 8 pieces. When solving the cube we use various letters to denote what side to turn and how to turn it. For example if you need to turn the top of the cube clockwise the letter "U" is used. However if it needs to be turned counterclockwise the notation of prime is added with an apostrophe like this U'.</p>
