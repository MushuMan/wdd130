        <!-- Information About Me -->
        I got my start in 6th grade with learning to solve the iconic 3x3 puzzle cube, more formally known as the Rubik's Cube. Growing up my oldest brother learned how to solve the puzzle, and from that I was immediately interested in how he did it. Was it magic? Sorcery? Did superman travel from an alternate dimension? Sadly for my overactive imagination it was nothing more than hard work and algorithms. So when I eventually asked him how it was done the response I got was, "here's the instruction booklet, have at it." I'd be lying if this is where I learned how to solve the enigma, for when I looked at that manual I gave up.
        However years later in 6th grade I met once again with the strange device during a meetup for math club. This time with me being slightly more mature I stuck with the process and found a great new hobby. It is from that love that I found for solving puzzles that I wish to educate those that may have wondered the same as I did many years ago. I won't lie, it takes a bit of memorization and even more persistence, but in the end you will be a master. Or you could just use the algorithms once and never worry about it again.

      <h3>General Information</h3>
      <p>
        <!-- About the cube -->
        The Rubik's cube was invented by Erno Rubik in 1974, hence the name Rubik's cube. Over the next few years the iconic toy was picked up by a few different manufacturers and eventually made its international debut in 1980. It didn't take long before the puzzle became a recognizable staple in homes around the world. As of today the Rubik's Cube is the best selling puzzle toy/game, with over 450 million of the brain-scratchers sold as of 2021. Over the years many have enjoyed playing around with the device and various techniques have arisen for solving the enigma. One prominent feature of the cubing community as it is called is the advent of speedcubing.

        <!-- About Speed Cubing -->
        With the popularity of the Rubik's Cube it didn't take long before a smaller community focused on solving the toy as fast as possible. During 1982 the first event was held for what is named speedcubing. This ended with the first holder of the world record with a speed of 22.95 seconds to solve by Minh Thai. Over the years this time has been cut down to ridiculous amounts. As of today the current world record holder is Max Park who achieved a singles time of 3.13 seconds to solve the puzzle. Along with this the current record holder for a series is Yiheng Wang with an average time of 4.48 seconds over a series of five solves. This is very impressive considering the many states a cube can be in, and that to solve it perfectly can be done in less than 20 moves for any given permutation. 

        <!-- Fun Facts -->
        Over at Google a team researched and concluded that for any given position, a Rubik's Cube can be solved in 20 moves or less. This is quite impressive given the amount of possible combinations the cube can be in. The classic 3x3 puzzle has a total of 43 quintillion possibilities with only one being solved. Because of this astronomical number the use of algorithms is needed in order to solve the puzzle from any position. There have been many different algorithms that have come up over the years for solving the puzzle, but each utilizes the same terminology.

        <!-- Terminology -->
        There are a few different terms used when talking about the Rubik's Cube. To understand these it's useful to know the different pieces of the cube first. Each puzzle has six sides composed of one center, four edges, and four corners. With these each side has a unique centerpiece which doesn't move. Every edge piece shares two sides, having two colors making a total of 12 pieces. Lastly every corner piece shares three sides having three colors and totalling to 8 pieces. When solving the cube we use various letters to denote what side to turn and how to turn it. For example if you need to turn the top of the cube clockwise the letter "U" is used. However if it needs to be turned counterclockwise the notation of prime is added with an apostrophe like this U'.

      <h3>Rubik's Cube</h3>
      <p>
        The following are steps for how to solve a Rubik's Cube. The letter R denotes turning the right side of the cube clockwise and R' denotes turning it counterclockwise. The letter L is for left, U for up, D for down, F for front, and B for back.

        <!-- Step 1 -->
        The first step to solving a Rubik's Cube doesn't involve any algorithms. The goal of this step is to create a cross on any color of your choice. For the sake of this tutorial white is the color of choice. In order to make the cross you set each edge piece for the white side in place. When doing this make sure that the non-white color matches the centerpiece of whichever side it's on. When this is done make sure that you flip the cube so that the cross is on the bottom. For the rest of the tutorial this side is the bottom side or D.

        <!-- Step 2 -->
        The second step to solving a Rubik's Cube is getting the four white(or whatever color you chose) corner pieces in the right place. To do this you must make sure that the two other colors match with each edge piece respectively. To start maneuver a corner piece with white above where it needs to go. For example, if the three colors on the corner are white, blue, and red, you will put that piece in between blue and red. First if white is on top you will want to use this algorithm with the corner piece on the right side: R U U R' U'. Now that the white color isn't on top, whichever other color that isn't on top, let's say blue, match it with that color's center, in this case blue matches with the blue center. Now look at the corner piece so that white is not facing towards you. Depending on what side the corner lies on use one of these two algorithms respectively;
        Left: L' U' L
        Right: R U R'
        Now repeat this for every bottom corner piece. Note if all your corner pieces are on the bottom but in the wrong spot or oriented wrong, you can insert any corner piece into that spot and that corner piece will be free to move around.

        <!-- Step 3 -->
        For step three we will be putting the middle edge pieces where they need to go. (If there are no middle edge pieces on the top layer you can insert any edge piece where the needed piece is to bump it into an area where you can use it.) For this example we have the blue-red edge piece on the top layer where red is on top. First match the color that isn't on top with its same center. Then look to see if the top color's center is to the right or left. In this case red is to the right of blue's center. (When doing the following algorithms face the cube so that the non-top color is in front.) Use these algorithms respectively for each case;
        If the top color is on the right: U R U R' U' F' U' F
        If the top color is on the left: U' L' U' L U F U F'
        Repeat this for every middle edge piece. Remember if an edge piece is inaccessible you can insert any other edge piece in its place to bump it out.

        <!-- Step 4 -->
        Step four is where things get a little more complicated. Depending on how the top four edge pieces are oriented use one of the following;
        If there are no matching edge pieces on top so that the top color isn't on top use: F U R U' R' F' With any side facing you. Then use the algorithm for having a line on top.
        If there is a line use: F U R U' R' F' with the line running horizontally, then repeat the algorithm again without rotating the cube.
        If there is an L shape with the edge pieces orient the cube so that the L is backwards. Then use: F U R U' R' F'.
        Now all four top edge pieces should be making a cross, and the next part of this step is putting them in the right place. First rotate the cube so that for any of the edge pieces the non-top color matches with its respective center. Check to see if any other colors match. If they all match, that's it for this step. If not use the following algorithms making sure that only one color matches;
        If the opposite color also matches, use: R U R' U R U U R' Then rotate the top side so that only one color matches.
        With the matching color facing you use: R U R' U R U U R'
        That is then the top cross done!

        <!-- Step 5 -->
        Step 5 is the most complicated step out of them all, but not by much. This step focuses solely on putting the top side's corner pieces in the right spot. If they are already in the right spot, regardless of whether they are oriented correctly then skip this step. First pick any corner piece not in the right spot and use the following algorithm with that piece on the right side: R' D' R, then rotate the top so that where that piece needs to go is on the right side. Pay attention to the piece occupying that spot then use: R' D R, then rotate the top so that where the second piece needs to go is on the right side and repeat the step until all corner pieces are in the right spot. 

        <!-- Step 6 -->
        This last step is to orient the corners so that the colors match. If they are already oriented correctly, congratulations, you've solved the Rubik's Cube! If not, rotate the cube so that a corner piece that isn't oriented correctly is on the right side. Then repeat the following algorithm until it is correctly oriented: R' D' R D, then turn the top side so that another incorrectly oriented corner is on the right side. Repeat this until all corners are correctly oriented.
        Congratulations! You've just solved a Rubik's Cube!
